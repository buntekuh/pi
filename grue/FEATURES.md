# Grue language features

## Target platform
Grue 1.0 targets the Z-machine via Inform 6. Glulx (graphics, sound, full Unicode) is deferred to a future version.

## Source handling
- Multi-line quoted strings joined by preprocessor
- Python-style indentation for all blocks (no braces or end keywords)
- `#` line comments
- `uses` directive (reserved, not yet emitted)

## Rooms
- `room Name "description"` — display name and inline description
- Description in body: `room Name` then `"description"` on next line
- Exits: `north: "Room Name"` or `north: room_id`

## Objects
Kinds: `object`, `scenery`, `man`, `woman`, `robot`

- Inline description: `object crowbar "A heavy iron crowbar."`
- Compound nouns: `object blue door "desc"` → id `blue_door`, name `blue door`
- Comma synonyms: `scenery mailbox, box "desc"` → id `mailbox`, parser accepts all synonyms
- Behaviours: `is openable`, `is lockable`, `is container`, `is supporter`
- Boolean attributes: `locked: true`, `open: true` — any property with value `true` becomes an I6 `has` attribute
- `is locked.` is equivalent to `locked: true`; `is closed.` is equivalent to `open: false`
- Properties: `key: item_id`, `inside: room_id`

## Kinds and attributes

```
bendable: straight, bent
texture: rough, stubbly, smooth
```

- Declares a named kind with a list of values; the first value is the default
- Two values → I6 `Attribute` (second value is the attribute name; first is its absence)
- Three or more values → I6 `Property` with named constants
- `true` and `false` are prohibited as values — forces meaningful names
- Value names are scoped to an object's declared kinds; qualify as `kind:value` when ambiguous across libraries

### Setting and testing attributes in handlers

```
locked.              ! give self locked;
not locked.          ! give self ~locked;
the noun is bent.    ! give noun bent;
the noun is not bent.
if locked:           ! self has locked
if not locked:       ! self hasnt locked
```

Friendly aliases resolve to their canonical I6 attribute:
- `closed.` / `if closed:` → `~open` / `hasnt open`
- `unlocked.` / `if unlocked:` → `~locked` / `hasnt locked`
- `off.` / `if off:` → `~on` / `hasnt on`

## Doors
- In-room: `door blue door "desc"` inside a room block, with `leads:` property
- Top-level: declared outside rooms with bidirectional exit injection

    ```
    door blue door "desc"
        east: Inside
        west: Front of House
        is openable.
    ```

- Partner doors automatically brought into scope via `add_to_scope`

## Verbs
```
verb examine
    takes noun
    "You see nothing special."

verb pry, tear, wrench
    takes noun with held noun
    "There's nothing to pry there."

verb give to
    takes noun to creature noun
    "They don't want it."
```

Grammar line: `takes [qualifier] noun` — qualifier is optional.

| Qualifier | Meaning | Applies to |
|---|---|---|
| *(none)* | any visible object | first or second noun |
| `held` | object the player carries | first or second noun |
| `creature` | an NPC | first or second noun |
| `multi` | multiple visible objects | first noun only |
| `held multi` | multiple carried objects | first noun only |

For two-noun verbs the preposition separating them (e.g. `with`, `to`, `in`) matches the verb name suffix.

**Important:** qualifiers are parse-time scope/possession filters only. You cannot filter by kind or attribute at grammar time — `takes wet noun` is not valid. To act only on wet objects, accept any noun and guard in the handler:

```
verb dry
    takes noun
    "You can't dry that."

    instead of dry:
        if self is wet:
            self is dry.
            say "You dry it."
        else:
            say "It's already dry."
```

- First word of verb name capitalised as I6 action base
- Emits action stub routine and `Verb` declaration

## Handlers
On objects and doors:

```
instead of prying with crowbar:
    if open:
        say "Already open."
    else:
        say "You lever it free."
        open.
```

- Timing: `instead of`, `on`, `after`
- Action matched by base verb form (`instead of pry`); gerund form also accepted for compatibility
- Second-noun filter: `with crowbar` → `if (second ~= crowbar) rfalse;`
- Conditionals: `if locked:` / `if not locked:` / `if closed:` / `else:` — any I6 attribute name
- Statements: `say "..."`, `locked.`, `not locked.`, `the noun is bent.`, `go room`, `box "..."`
- `after` handlers emit to Inform 6 `after` property; all others to `before`
- `on turn N:` fires on a specific turn count via `each_turn` with `turns == N` guard
- `each turn:` fires every turn via `each_turn`

## Say / string features
- `say "text"` in handlers emits `print`
- `{obj}` interpolation → `(name) obj` for known game objects, bare expression otherwise
- `{the obj}` → `(the) obj`, `{a obj}` → `(a) obj`
- `{s var}` → plural s: prints "s" unless var == 1 (e.g. `{item_count} item{s item_count}`)
- Runtime object variables resolved automatically: `noun`, `second`, `self`, `actor`, `location`
- `\n` → `^` (Inform 6 newline)
- `\t` → `@@9` (tab character)
- `"` → `~` (Inform 6 string escape)
- ISO 8859-1 characters (é, ñ, ü, etc.) encoded automatically as `@@decimal`
- Extra whitespace normalised

## Tests
```
test "default"
    take crowbar. "Taken."
    east. "Inside"
```
Writes a `.gts` JSON file alongside the `.inf` for use by a test runner.

## Planned
- User-defined functions — named routines callable from handlers, for shared logic


Handlers: subject-qualified conditions (`if murderer is wet:`, `if bag has gun:`) not yet implemented.
Kind declarations: the `bendable: straight, bent` system was designed but not yet implemented in the compiler.
